# Quality Assurance Checklist 
To make reviews more efficient, please make sure the software feature meets the following standards and check everything off that meets the quality check. Once everything has been checked, the assigned reviewers will begin the review process. _Edit this description to check off the list._

There are exceptions with all guidelines. As long as your decisions are justified, then you are good! Contact the reviewers or the leads about any exceptions.
