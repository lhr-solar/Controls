/**
 * @file PedalToPercent.c
 * @brief This file contains an array for converting a pedal percentage (the
 * index into the array) into a float between 0 and 1, inclusive. The mapping is
 * currently linear, but this can be changed. The file was created in order to
 * avoid costly floating point operations (since we've turned the floating point
 * unit off).
